/**
 * Thinking through editing vegetables:
 *
 * High-level workflow:
 * - Create an edit suggestion with a diff and snapshot
 * - The diff is in the shape of `json-diff-ts`
 * - Create a dashboard to review suggestions, admin only
 * - Admins can approve or reject suggestions
 * - When approved, the diff is applied to the vegetable
 *
 * Complications:
 * 1. We can't just send the base64 of the images inside of the diff, it'd be too heavy for the DB
 *   	- then we need to upload the images to Sanity first
 * 2. Applying the diff is not trivial
 * 3. Ideally users should be able to see their own edit suggestions
 * 4. Ideally users would be notified when their suggestion is approved or rejected
 *
 * For now, skipping 3. and 4.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * 1. âœ… server action to createEditSuggestion
 * 		1. diffs the current and updated objects
 * 		2. uploads new images in the diff to Sanity
 * 		3. replaces photos with data of `NewImage` with `StoredImage` based on the uploaded data
 * 2. use this routeHandler to replace each photo in the uploaded object with a StoredImage instead
 * 3. diff the objects and create the EditSuggestion
 * 4. find out how to apply EditSuggestion
 *
 *
 * LEARNINGS WITH DIFFS
 * - When I ADD a friend, or any array of primitives, I get ADD, fine
 * - When I DELETE an item from an array of primitives, I get REMOVE, also fine
 * - But when I DELETE an item and add another at the same index, I get UPDATE, which could be tricky for friendships
 * 		- FIND WAY TO DELETE FRIENDSHIPS THAT WERE REMOVED
 * - Changes in arrays are grouped under the `changes` array
 * - Updating photos' meta is working fine
 * - Deleting a photo and uploading another on top changes the ID (via ImageInput), and leads to an ADD
 * - atomizeChangeset will flatten changes

 * 4. diffs the updated vegetable with these `StoredImage`s applied
 * 5. stores the diff in the database
 *
 * This workflow for images avoids us having to store the entire base_64 in the database.
 * As a result, diffs are lighter and actually usable.
