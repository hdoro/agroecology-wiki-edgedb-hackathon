# Gororobas, an agroecology wiki for EdgeDB's hackathon

![Screenshot of the app](./public/default-og.png)

‚ú® The app is live at: https://gororobas.com

This is a Typescript project built leveraging the following technologies:

- [EdgeDB](https://edgedb.com): database and authentication
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and [React](https://react.dev/): frontend frameworks
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): deployment
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/): styling and component primitives
- [Effect](https://effect.website): typescript tooling for more robust and type-safe code
- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io): observability
- [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io): image storage and CDN
- [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/): email server for local development
- [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev): rich text editor
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com): form state management
- [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com): drag and drop for lists in form
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io): package manager
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev): linter and prettifier
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) and [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/): pre-commit hooks to ensure everything is OK
- [Bun](https://bun.sh): Javascript runtime for faster local development

## Introduction to the project

![Screenshot of the app](./public/presentation-peek.png)

You can learn about the project's motivation, tech stack, approach and learnings here: https://hdoro.mmm.page/edgedb-hackathon

## Developing locally

1. Start by populating the `.env.example` file with the necessary environment variables. You can copy it to `.env.local` and fill in the values.
    - If you're connected to the Vercel project, you can use `vercel env pull` to build the production `.env` file.
1. In order to authenticate with emails locally, you need to install and run [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/). This will allow the EdgeDB server to send emails via your local Mailpit server.
    - üí° You can still authenticate with Google oAuth without it
1. To connect to a local database, [install EdgeDB](https://docs.edgedb.com/get-started/quickstart#installation) to your machine
1. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
1. In a separate terminal, run `edgedb ui` to open the EdgeDB Studio
1. Then, in the same EdgeDB terminal, run `edgedb watch` to have it watch changes to your schema
1. After EdgeDB has applied the necessary migrations, run `bun run generate:all` to have the types and our custom EdgeQL SDK generated. This is necessary to interact with the database and the project won't run without it.
1. After generating types, run `bun run auth:setup` to configure EdgeDB with the proper authentication settings
1. Finally, run `bun run dev` to start the development server and access the app at `http://localhost:3000`

## Deploying the app and database

1. Log into EdgeDB Cloud in your terminal with `edgedb cloud login`
1. Migrate the current database schema to the cloud with `edgedb migrate -I ORG/INSTANCE_NAME`
1. If you're starting a new cloud instance, you can seed it with a local dump of data with:
    ```sh
    edgedb dump <your-dump.dump>
    edgedb restore -I <org>/<instance-name> <your-dump.dump>
    ```
1. If you're setting up a Vercel project for it the first time, refer to the [official guide on deploying to Vercel](https://docs.edgedb.com/guides/tutorials/nextjs_app_router#deploying-to-vercel)
1. When you push a commit to main, Vercel will automatically build and deploy it to `gororobas.com` or whatever the domain for the new project you've set up

    ```
    Failed creating vegetable QueryError: invalid reference to link property in top level shape
    |       single @order_index := __forVar__0.order_index
    ```
    - Happened with `edgedb@/1.6.0-canary.20240510T201054` and `@edgedb/generate@0.6.0-canary.20240510T202700` as well as the latest `@edgedb/generate@0.5.3`
    - tried renaming to just `order`, also didn't work
- Learn from Michael: https://github.com/mikearnaldi/next-effect/blob/main/app/page.tsx
- [ ] NoteForm: Allow modifying `published_at`
- [ ] Edit note - for now, it's a Twitter like thing where you can only send/delete, no edit üòù
- [ ] RichTextEditor: internal links to other objects WithHandle
- [ ] Form validation: can we validate the encoded schema instead of fully decoding it? It'd make it slightly faster with images not needing to be processed.
